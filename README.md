# System Design 6


**Designing a Youtube/Netflix like service**

**What to be designed?**

1. Design a simpler version of video-sharing service like Youtube/Netflix where users can upload/search/view videos
2. Users can upload, view, share, like/dislike and report the videos. Comments can also be added to the videos.

**Feature Requirements**

Primary Features:

1. Video uploading, sharing and viewing features should be provided for the user. User should also be able to search for videos based on their titles
2. Service should record video stats such as likes/dislikes, total view count, average view time etc. 
3. Viewers should be able to add and view comments on videos

Secondary Requirements:

1. High reliability is the most important requirement; no video uploaded can be lost
2. Consistency can sometimes be affected in the interest of availability; So, if a user doesn't see a video for sometime, it is fine.
3. While watching the videos, users should have real-time experience and should not have any lag 


Out of scope: Video recommendations, most popular videos, channels, subscriptions, watch later, favorites, etc.
